# Data Normalization

### Overview

Although this dataset came from a public source and was mostly in a format that was usable, I took this opportunity to explore the data and discovered that the table could be optimized. The following is a screenshot of the columns and the first few rows of the raw data set:

<br />

I identified three different attributes that could be broken out into different tables: Platform, Genre, and Publisher. These columns contain string data and can have multiple of the same value within their respective columns, e.g. having 'Nintendo' multiple times per the screenshot. Even though this particular dataset is able to fit in a spreadsheet, this would not be an ideal situation for a much larger dataset and processing time for running SQL queries would be reduced. Using Google Sheets, I created these three new tables, created ids for each table (primary keys), and mapped the ids to the games table which was created by taking a copy of the raw data and adding in new columns to map the ids to the new tables. The process for creating the platform, genre, and publisher tables were the same, so I will walkthrough the process of creating the platform table which was then applied to the other tables.

### Creating Tables

I created two columns for the platform table: *platform_id* and *platform_name*. *platform_name* was generated by taking the unique values of the platform column from the raw data, and although unnecssary, I sorted the values alphabetically. *platform_id* was generated by starting at 1 and incrementing the vlue by 1 for each row. Below is a screenshot of the first few rows of the platform table along with the formula used to generate *platform_name*:

<br />

This created the first inconsistency by separating data because '2600' was formatted as a number, and I converted the entire column in both the platform and games tables to ensure the same data type.

<br />

Once these tables were created, it was time to finalize making the games table. To do this, I mapped the record for each of these three attributes to their respective tables by using an INDEX/MATCH function. Below is a screenshot of the formula and mapping process used for the *platform_id* with the same methodology being applied to the other id columns:

<br />

Because I wanted to remove the platform, genre, and publisher columns, and their respective id columns were referencing these columns, I needed to hardcode everything so those columns could be removed without causing errors. The [vgsales_draft.xlsx](https://github.com/RyanGruber1995/video_game_sales/blob/main/vgsales_draft.xlsx) file keeps track of the formulas I created before hardcoding and removing columns while the [vgsales_final.xlsx](https://github.com/RyanGruber1995/video_game_sales/blob/main/vgsales_final.xlsx) file shows the finalized tables that were uploaded into BigQuery for further analysis.

### Data Exploration and cleaning

The first thing I did was create a dataset called vgsales as well as tables for the four tables that were created during the data normalization process as shown here:

<br />

I initially took some time to explore the data and confirm that the data was ready for use. The first issue I came across was the schema of the games table as the data type of the year column was a string. Upon further analysis I noticed that some games had a year of 'N/A' as either the year was probably unknown of just not entered. By running the following code, I discovered that 271 games had this issue. It wouldn't be hard to fix this by researching when those games were released and updating them to have the complete dataset, but as there are so many to account for I decided to remove those observations.

    # Count number of rows that have year as 'N/A'
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM vgsales.games
    WHERE year = "N/A"

    # Delete rows where year is unknown
    DELETE FROM vgsales.games WHERE year = "N/A"

I know from the site where I pulled this dataset that the data tracked games since 1980, but not necessary what the most recent year was. To find this out I ran the following query and got the following output:

    # Count games from each year
    SELECT 
      year,
      COUNT(*) AS num_of_games
    FROM vgsales.games
    GROUP BY year
    ORDER BY year ASC

| year 	| num_of_games |
| :---  | :--- |
1980	| 9    
1981	| 46
1982	| 36
1983	| 17
1984	| 14
1985	| 14
1986	| 21
1987	| 16
1988	| 15
1989	| 17
1990	| 16
1991	| 41
1992	| 43
1993	| 60
1994	| 121
1995	| 219
1996	| 263
1997	| 289
1998	| 379
1999	| 338
2000	| 349
2001	| 482
2002	| 829
2003	| 775
2004	| 763
2005	| 941
2006	| 1008
2007	| 1202
2008	| 1428
2009	| 1431
2010	| 1259
2011	| 1139
2012	| 657
2013	| 546
2014	| 582
2015	| 614
2016	| 344
2017	| 3
2020	| 1

Although the distribution is not uniform for each year, it makes sense that there are way fewer games in the earlier years as not as many games were released compared to later years and was harder to track every game that was released. However, I did find it interesting to see that only 3 games were released in 2017 and only 1 game was released in 2020 while no games in 2018 nor 2019 were recorded. Let's see which games those are:

    # Get the games that were "released" in 2017 and 2020
    SELECT 
        name,
        year
    FROM vgsales.games
    WHERE year = 2017 OR year = 2020

| name | year |
| :--- | :--- |
| Imagine: Makeup Artist | 2020
| Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 4: Deluxe Package | 2017
| Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 4: Deluxe Package | 2017
| Brothers Conflict: Precious Baby | 2017

Since there were only a few games that were possibly recorded incorrectly, I did a quick Google search to see when these games were released and confirmed the years were wrong. The following query resolved this issue:

    # Update years for games in 2017 and 2020
    UPDATE vgsales.games
    SET year = 2009
    WHERE name = "Imagine: Makeup Artist"

    UPDATE vgsales.games
    SET year = 2007
    WHERE name = "Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 4: Deluxe Package"

    UPDATE vgsales.games
    SET year = 2016
    WHERE name = "Brothers Conflict: Precious Baby"

Running the query to get the games released in 2017 or 2020 posed another issue - possible duplicate data as one of the games showed up twice. I ran the first following query and got back 2,717 games that had duplicate names, but the second query that selected the unique rows produced the same number of rows (16,327) as the original games table meaning that there are no dupllicate entries:

    # Find duplicate names and number of occurences
    SELECT
      DISTINCT name,
      COUNT(name) AS num_instances
    FROM vgsales.games
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING num_instances > 1

    # Find unique records
    SELECT DISTINCT *
    FROM vgsales.games

Upon further investigation, the games that had duplicate names were either instances of a game that were released on different platforms or remakes of the same game that were released in later years. Now that the data has been explored and cleaned, let's do some analysis!

### Nintendo Analysis

For this part of the project, I pretended that I was an analyst for my favorite game company - Nintendo. Let's assume I was asked the question *"What is our best selling game series?"* To answer this, I would need to categorize each game as different games can belong to the same series. To create a variable and make sure it's working I ran the following query with the following results (first 5 lines only):

    # Categorize Nintendo games
    SELECT
      name,
      CASE
        WHEN name LIKE '%Mario%' THEN 'Mario'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Pok%mon%' THEN 'Pokemon'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Zelda%' THEN 'Zelda'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Donkey Kong%' THEN 'Donkey Kong'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Kirby%' THEN 'Kirby'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Metroid%' THEN 'Metroid'
        WHEN name LIKE '%Animal Crossing%' THEN 'Animal Crossing'
        ELSE "Other"
      END AS game_series
    FROM vgsales.games g JOIN vgsales.publisher p ON g.publisher_id = p.publisher_id
    WHERE p.publisher_name = 'Nintendo'
    ORDER BY game_id ASC

| name	| game_series |
| :---  | :---        |
| Wii Sports	| Other
| Super Mario Bros.	| Mario
| Mario Kart Wii	| Mario
| Wii Sports Resort	| Other
| Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue	| Pokemon
