# Video Game Sales 

This project showcases the process of analyzing video game sales mainly with SQL queries and Tableau visualizations, along with some data normalization in spreadsheets. The dataset used for this project is the [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) data found on Kaggle and tracks the sales data for various games since 1980 as well as other metrics of each game including the year of release, the platform it was released on, the genre of the game, and the publisher. I devised my own business questions to perform deeper analysis in these applications.
